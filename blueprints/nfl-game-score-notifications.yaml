  name: NFL Game Score Notification
  description: >
    Designed for Home Assistant mobile app notifications.
    Will send a notification with NFL game information, triggered by any score change(optionally ignoring opponent scores).
    
    
    Requires the [ha-nfl integration by @zacs](https://github.com/zacs/ha-nfl).
    
    
    The NFL notifications will be grouped together and tagged so that as new scores come in each game, 
    individual game notifications are replaced with the updated scores.
