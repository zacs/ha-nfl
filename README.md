# Real-time Sports Scores in Home Assistant

This integration provides real-time scores for teams and athletes (beta) in multiple professional (NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, and more), college (NCAA), and international (soccer, golf, tennis, racing, cricket) sports using the ESPN Scoreboard APIs, and creates a sensor with attributes for the details of the game. 

This integration can be used with the [ha-teamtracker-card](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker-card) to display the game information in the Home Assistant dashboard.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki) for FAQs, troubleshooting advise, and custom API configurations that have been already been validated.  Please contribute to help others.

This integration is a fork of the excellent [ha-nfl](https://github.com/zacs/ha-nfl) custom component by @zacs.  Thanks for the starting place!

#### Version Compatibility
 - Releases for [ha-teamtracker](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker) and [ha-teamtracker-card](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker-card) follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH convention.
 - All teamtracker and teamtracker-card releases with the same MAJOR and MINOR version numbers will be compatible, regardless of PATCH version.
 - For example, any teamtracker v0.2.x will be compatible with any teamtracker-card v0.2.y.
 - Compatibility is not guaranteed across different MAJOR or MINOR version numbers.

## Supported Teams and Leagues
TeamTracker will work for any of the hundreds of teams/leagues for which an ESPN scoreboard API exists.  

A small subset of the most popular teams/leagues have been pre-configured to simplify their setup.  This is referred to as native support.  Unfortunately, given the large number of teams/leagues for which APIs exist, it is impossible to provide native support for all of them.  

The remaining teams/leagues are still supported, however they require a couple extra steps to set up.  This is referred to as setting up a Custom API Configuration.  Custom API Configurations require more steps to set up, however once set up, they behave the same way that a natively supported sensor does.  There is no difference, for example, between a team playing in a natively supported soccer league or a non-natively supported soccer league other than the extra steps needed to initially set up the non-natively supported one.

### Natively Supported (Pre-Configured) Sports / Leagues

The following leagues are supported natively:
- Australian Football - AFL (beta)
- Baseball - MLB
- Basketball - NBA, WNBA, NCAAM, NCAAW, WNBA
- Football - NFL, NCAAF
- Golf - PGA
- Hockey - NHL
- MMA - UFC
- U.S. Soccer - MLS, NWSL
- International Soccer - BUND (German Bundesliga), CL (Champions League), EPL (English Premiere League), LIGA (Spanish LaLiga), LIG1 (French Ligue 1), SERA (Italian Serie A), WC (World Cup)
- Racing - F1, IRL
- Tennis - ATP, WTA
- Volleyball - NCAAVB, NCAAVBW

### Sports / Leagues Supported via Custom API Configurations

It is possible to configure Team Tracker to use a custom API beyond those for the pre-configured leagues.  

All ESPN APIs use a URL in the following format:
https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{SPORT_PATH}/{LEAGUE_PATH}/scoreboard
where {SPORT_PATH} is the sport and {LEAGUE_PATH} is the league that the team plays in.

For example, for the NFL, the URL is https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard

Once you know the URL with the scoreboard of your team, it is possible to configure Team Tracker to use it.  the [Custom API Configuration section of the Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki/Custom-API-Configurations) contains more details on how to determine the {SPORT_PATH} and {LEAGUE_PATH} as well as some that have been verified to work and some that are known to not be compatible.  Please update the Wiki if you try others.

The [FAQ in the Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) also contains an explanation of the types of sports that work with the teamtracker integration and those that currently do not.

The Configuration section below provides more details for configuring both types of sensors.

## Sensor Data

### State
The sensor is pretty simple: the main state is `PRE`, `IN`, `POST`, `BYE` or `NOT_FOUND`, but there are attributes for pretty much all aspects of the game, when available. State definitions are as you'd expect:
- `PRE`: The game is in pre-game state. This happens when ESPN publishes the pre-game info via their API.  The lead time varies based on the league.
- `IN`: The game is in progress.
- `POST`: The game has completed. 
- `BYE`: Your given team has a bye week this week. Note that attributes available are limited in this case (only abreviation, name, logo, and last updated time will be available). 
- `NOT_FOUND`: There is no game found for your team, nor is there a bye. This can happen if an invalid league or team ID has been entered.  It can also happen at the end of the season or mid-season when ESPN hasn't published the pre-game info for the next game.  See the [Wiki for help in troubleshooting tips](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki/Troubleshooting:--State-=--NOT_FOUND) when you believe the sensor is incorrectly in the `NOT_FOUND` state.

### Attributes
The attributes available will change based on the sensor's state, a small number are always available (league, team abbreviation, team name, and logo), but otherwise the attributes only populate when in the current state. The table below lists which attributes are available in which states. 

Some attributes are only available for certain sports.

## Installation

### Manually

Clone or download this repository and copy the "teamtracker" directory to your "custom_components" directory in your config directory

```<config directory>/custom_components/teamtracker/...```
  
### HACS

1. Open the HACS section of Home Assistant.
2. In Integrations, click the "+ EXPLORE & DOWNLOAD REPOSITORIES" button in the bottom right corner.
3. In the window that opens search for "Team Tracker Card".
4. Select "Team Tracker Card" from the list
5. Select the "Download" button in the buttom right corner.
6. Select "Download" from the window to download the button.
7. When given the Option, Reload.

 - HACS should automatically add the following to your resources:
```
url: /hacsfiles/ha-teamtracker-card/ha-teamtracker-card.js
type: Javascript Module
```
  
## Configuration

### Configuration via the "Configuration->Integrations" section of the Home Assistant UI

Search for the integration labeled "Team Tracker" and select it.  Enter the desired League from the League List below and your team's ID in the UI prompt. If NCAA football or basketball, enter the Conference ID from Conference ID Numbers below if desired.  You can also enter a friendly name. If you keep the default, your sensor will be `sensor.team_tracker`, otherwise it will be `sensor.friendly_name_you_picked`. 

When using the Home Assistant UI to set up a Custom API Configuration, simply enter 'XXX' in the League field.  This will trigger a second dialogue box which will allow you to enter the values for the {SPORT_PATH} and {LEAGUE_PATH}.

#### Use of a Wild Card In Place of Athlete's Name

For individual sports, you can use the single `*` character as a Wild Card in place of the athlete's name.  This will cause the sensor to match an athlete using sport-specific logic.

The Wild Card acts in the following manner
| Sport | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Golf | Displays the current leader and competitor in second place |
| MMA | Displays the current active fight or the next upcoming fight if none are active |
| Racing | Displays the current leader and competitor in second place |
| Tennis | Results will be unpredictable due to multiple tournaments and matches in progress at once |

### Manual Configuration in your `configuration.yaml` file

To create a sensor instance add the following configuration to your sensor definitions using the team_id found above.  Enclose the values in quotes to avoid unrealized conflicts w/ predefined terms in YAML (i.e. NO being interpreted as No):

```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "NFL"
  team_id: "NO"
```

After you restart Home Assistant then you should have a new sensor called `sensor.team_tracker` in your system.

You can overide the sensor default name (`sensor.team_tracker`) to one of your choosing by setting the `name` option:

```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "NFL"
  team_id: "NO"
  name: "Saints"
```

Using the configuration example above the sensor will then be called "sensor.saints".

To set a Conference ID for an NCAA football or basketball team, use the following:

```
  - platform: teamtracker
    league_id: "NCAAF"
    team_id: "BGSU"
    conference_id: 15
    name: "Falcons"
```

To set up a Custom API Configuration, set the league_id to 'XXX' and enter the desired values for sport_path and league_path.
```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "XXX"
  team_id: "OSU"
  sport_path: "volleyball"
  league_path: "womens-college-volleyball"
  name: "Buckeyes_VB"
```

### League List ###

For the League, the following values are valid:
- ATP (Assc. of Tennis Professionals)
- BUND (German Bundesliga)
- CL (Champions League)
- EPL (English Premiere League)
- F1 (Formula 1 Racing)
- IRL (Indy Racing League)
- LIGA (Spanish LaLiga)
- LIG1 (French Ligue 1)
- MLB (Major League Baseball)
- MLS (Major League Soccer)
- NBA (National Basketball Assc.)
- NCAAF (NCAA Football)
- NCAAM (NCAA Men's Basketball)
- NCAAW (NCAA Women's Basketball)
- NCAAVB (NCAA Men's Volleyball)
- NCAAVBW (NCAA Women's Volleyball)
- NFL (National Football League)
- NWSL (National Women's Soccer League)
- PGA (Professional Golfers' Assc.)
- SERA (Italian Serie A)
- UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)
- WC (World Cup)
- WNBA (Women's NBA)
- WTA (Women's Tennis Assc.)
- XXX (Custom API Configuration)
    
For the Team, you'll need to know the team ID ESPN uses for your team.  This is the 2-, 3- or 4-letter abbreviation (eg. "SEA" for Seattle or "NE" for New England) ESPN uses when space is limited.  You can generally find them at https://espn.com/ in the top scores UI, but they can also be found in other pages with team stats as well.  

NOTE:  In rare instances, the team ID will vary based on your local language.  While rare, changing the language after a sensor is set up can cause it to stop working.

For individual sports, you should specify the althlete's name in `team_id` field.  This will cause the sensor to track the competitions matching the name of the specified athlete.  You should use as much of the name (i.e. last name, full name) as needed to uniquely identify the athlete.

### Conference ID Numbers

By default, NCAA football and basketball will only find a game if at least one of the teams playing is ranked.  In order to find games in which both teams are unranked, you must specify a Conference ID, which is a number used by ESPN to identify college conferences and other groups of teams.  Conferences ID's are not consistent across football and basketball.

The following is a list of the college conferences and the corresponding number ESPN uses for their Conference ID.  For games involving at least one ranked team, no Conference ID is needed.

| Conference | Football Conference ID | Basketball Conference ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACC | 1 | 2 |
| American | 151 | 62 |
| Big 12 | 4 | 8 |
| Big Ten | 5 | 7 |
