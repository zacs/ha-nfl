# Real-time Sports Scores in Home Assistant

This integration provides real-time scores for teams in multiple professional (NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, and more), college (NCAA), and international (soccer) sports using ESPN APIs, and creates a sensor with attributes for the details of the game. 

This integration can be used with the [ha-teamtracker-card](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker-card) to display the game information in the Home Assistant dashboard.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki) for FAQs, troubleshooting advise, and custom API configurations that have been already been validated.  Please contribute to help others.

This integration is a fork of the excellent [ha-nfl](https://github.com/zacs/ha-nfl) custom component by @zacs.  Thanks for the starting place!

#### Version Compatibility
 - Releases for [ha-teamtracker](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker) and [ha-teamtracker-card](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker-card) follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH convention.
 - All teamtracker and teamtracker-card releases with the same MAJOR and MINOR version numbers will be compatible, regardless of PATCH version.
 - For example, any teamtracker v0.2.x will be compatible with any teamtracker-card v0.2.y.
 - Compatibility is not guaranteed across MAJOR or MINOR version numbers.

## Sensor Data

### State
The sensor is pretty simple: the main state is `PRE`, `IN`, `POST`, `BYE` or `NOT_FOUND`, but there are attributes for pretty much all aspects of the game, when available. State definitions are as you'd expect:
- `PRE`: The game is in pre-game state. This happens when ESPN publishes the pre-game info via their API.  The lead time varies based on the league.
- `IN`: The game is in progress.
- `POST`: The game has completed. 
- `BYE`: Your given team has a bye week this week. Note that attributes available are limited in this case (only abreviation, name, logo, and last updated time will be available). 
- `NOT_FOUND`: There is no game found for your team, nor is there a bye. This can happen if an invalid league or team ID has been entered.  It can also happen at the end of the season or mid-season when ESPN hasn't published the pre-game info for the next game. 

### Attributes
The attributes available will change based on the sensor's state, a small number are always available (league, team abbreviation, team name, and logo), but otherwise the attributes only populate when in the current state. The table below lists which attributes are available in which states. 

Some attributes are only available for certain sports.

## Installation

### Manually

Clone or download this repository and copy the "teamtracker" directory to your "custom_components" directory in your config directory

```<config directory>/custom_components/teamtracker/...```
  
### HACS

1. Open the HACS section of Home Assistant.
2. Click the "..." button in the top right corner and select "Custom Repositories."
3. In the window that opens paste this Github URL.
4. In the window that opens when you select it click om "Install This Repository in HACS"
  
## Configuration

For the League, the following values are valid:
- BUND (German Bundesliga)
- EPL (English Premiere League)
- LIGA (Spanish LaLiga)
- LIG1 (French Ligue 1)
- MLB (Major League Baseball)
- MLS (Major League Soccer)
- NBA (National Basketball Assc)
- NCAAF (NCAA Football)
- NCAAM (NCAA Men's Basketball)
- NCAAW (NCAA Women's Basketball)
- NCAAVB (NCAA Men's Volleyball)
- NCAAVBW (NCAA Women's Volleyball)
- NFL (National Football League)
- NWSL (National Women's Soccer League)
- SERA (Italian Serie A)
- WNBA (Women's NBA)
    
For the Team, you'll need to know the team ID ESPN uses for your team.  This is the 2-, 3- or 4-letter abbreviation (eg. "SEA" for Seattle or "NE" for New England) ESPN uses when space is limited.  You can generally find them at https://espn.com/ in the top scores UI, but they can also be found in other pages with team stats as well.

By default, NCAA football and basketball will only find a game if at least one of the teams playing is ranked.  In order to find games in which both teams are unranked, you must specify a Conference ID, which is a number used by ESPN to identify college conferences and other groups of teams.

The following is a list of the college conferences and the corresponding number ESPN uses for their Conference ID.  For games involving at least one ranked team, no Conference ID is needed.

## Conference ID Numbers
| Conference | Conference ID |
| --- | --- |
| ACC | 1 |
| American | 151 |
| Big 12 | 4 |
| Big Ten | 5 |
| C-USA | 12 |
| FBS Independent | 18 |
| MAC | 15 |
| Mountain West | 17 |
| PAC-12 | 9 |
| SEC | 8 |
| Sun Belt | 37 |
| ASUN | 176 |
| Big Sky | 20 |
| Big South | 40 |
| CAA | 18 |
| Ivy | 22 |
| MEAC | 24 |
| MVFC | 21 |
| NEC | 25 |
| OVC | 26 |
| Patriot | 27 |
| Pioneer | 28 |
| SWAC | 31 |
| Southern | 29 |
| Southland | 30 |
| WAC | 16 |

The following identifiers are also valid:
| Additional Groupings | Conference ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FBS (1-A) | 80 | Subset of unranked FBS games |
| FCS (1-AA) | 81 | Subset of FCS games |
| DIVII/III | 35 | Subset of D2/D3 games |

### Via the "Configuration->Integrations" section of the Home Assistant UI

Search for the integration labeled "Team Tracker" and select it.  Enter the desired League from the list above and your team's ID in the UI prompt. If NCAA football or basketball, enter the Conference ID from above if desired.  You can also enter a friendly name. If you keep the default, your sensor will be `sensor.team_tracker`, otherwise it will be `sensor.friendly_name_you_picked`. 

### Manually in your `configuration.yaml` file

To create a sensor instance add the following configuration to your sensor definitions using the team_id found above.  Enclose the values in quotes to avoid unrealized conflicts w/ predefined terms in YAML (i.e. NO being interpreted as No):

```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "NFL"
  team_id: "NO"
```

After you restart Home Assistant then you should have a new sensor called `sensor.team_tracker` in your system.

You can overide the sensor default name (`sensor.team_tracker`) to one of your choosing by setting the `name` option:

```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "NFL"
  team_id: "NO"
  name: "Saints"
```

Using the configuration example above the sensor will then be called "sensor.saints".

To set a Conference ID for an NCAA football or basketball team, use the following:

```
  - platform: teamtracker
    league_id: "NCAAF"
    team_id: "BGSU"
    conference_id: 15
    name: "Falcons"
```

## Custom API Configuration

It is possible to configure Team Tracker to use a custom API beyond those for the pre-configured leagues.  Please note that the APIs for many of the more obscure sports will produce an error because they do not return enough data to drive the sensor.

All ESPN APIs use a URL in the following format:
https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{SPORT_PATH}/{LEAGUE_PATH}/scoreboard
where {SPORT_PATH} is the sport and {LEAGUE_PATH} is the league that the team plays in.

For example, for the NFL, the URL is https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard

If you know the URL with the scoreboard of your team, it is possible to configure Team Tracker to use it.  the [Custom API Configuration section of the Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki/Custom-API-Configurations) contains more details on how to determine the {SPORT_PATH} and {LEAGUE_PATH} as well as some that have been verified to work and some that are known to not be compatible.  Please update the Wiki if you try others.

The [FAQ in the Wiki](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) also contains an explanation of the types of sports that work with the teamtracker integration and those that currently do not.

### Via the "Configuration->Integrations" section of the Home Assistant UI

When using the Home Assistant UI to set up your sensor, simply enter 'XXX' in the League field.  This will trigger a second dialogue box which will allow you to enter the values for the {SPORT} and {LEAGUE}.

### Manually in your `configuration.yaml` file

To use YAML to set up your sensor, set the league_id to 'XXX' and enter the desired values for sport_path and league_path.
```
- platform: teamtracker
  league_id: "XXX"
  team_id: "OSU"
  sport_path: "volleyball"
  league_path: "womens-college-volleyball"
  name: "Buckeyes_VB"
```
